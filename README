This Chrome extension allows the Discord web client "push to talk" (PTT) mode
to operate from any tab in the browser (or system-wide). When cued with its own
shortcut key combo, the extension emulates PTT keydown / keyup events in open
Discord tabs.

To operate:
  1) Install the extension in Chrome.

  2) Set the extension shortcut (in chrome://extensions/shortcuts) to your
     prefered PTT key combo. If you are not using Chrome OS, you may also set
     the shortcut to global to use it outside of a Chrome tab.

  3) Reload Discord web client tabs, and enable PTT mode. The particular key
     combo specified in your Discord web settings is not used and does not
     matter.

  4) (Optional) click the extension icon to tune your minimum PTT length. Due
     to Chrome extension shortcut architecture, too-short of a minimum PTT
     length might lead to PTT "bouncing".
